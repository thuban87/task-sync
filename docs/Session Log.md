## 2026-02-03 - Initial Development & Production Release

**Focus:** Complete plugin development from scaffolding to production deployment

### Completed:

#### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding
- ✅ Created `manifest.json`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`
- ✅ Created `esbuild.config.mjs` (build config)
- ✅ Created `deploy.mjs` (multi-environment deployment script: test/staging/production)
- ✅ Created `.agent/workflows/deploy.md` workflow
- ✅ Installed dependencies (`npm install`)

#### Phase 2: Core Constants & Models
- ✅ Created `src/constants.ts` (priority markers, regex patterns)
- ✅ Created `src/models/PriorityTask.ts` (task interfaces)

#### Phase 3: Services
- ✅ `TaskScannerService.ts` - Vault scanning with metadataCache optimization
- ✅ `DailyNoteService.ts` - Daily note detection (Periodic Notes/Daily Notes compatible)
- ✅ `FileWatcherService.ts` - File modification watching with debounce
- ✅ `ReverseSyncService.ts` - Daily Note → Source file sync
- ✅ `SourceToDailySyncService.ts` - Source file → Daily Note sync (true two-way)

#### Phase 4: Settings & Main Entry
- ✅ Created `src/settings.ts` with full settings UI
- ✅ Created `main.ts` (plugin entry point)
- ✅ Manual sync command: "Sync priority tasks now"

#### Phase 5: Feature Implementation

**Two-Way Task Sync:**
- ✅ Vault → Daily Note: Priority tasks auto-sync to section header
- ✅ Daily Note → Source: Checkbox changes propagate back to source files
- ✅ Source → Daily Note: Checkbox changes in source update daily note
- ✅ Task deduplication (only uncompleted tasks count)
- ✅ Daily note creation listener (auto-sync on new daily note)

**Exclusion Settings:**
- ✅ Excluded folders (with path autocomplete)
- ✅ Excluded files (with path autocomplete)  
- ✅ Excluded file names (matches across all directories)

**Priority Filters:**
- ✅ Include highest priority (⏫) toggle
- ✅ Include high priority (🔺) toggle
- ✅ Configurable task limit

#### Phase 6: Production Cleanup
- ✅ Removed all verbose debug logging (39 console.log statements)
- ✅ Kept only essential logs (plugin load/unload)
- ✅ Deployed to test, staging, and production vaults

```

### Testing Notes:

- ✅ Build passes (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Deployed and tested on test vault
- ✅ Deployed and tested on staging vault  
- ✅ Deployed to production vault
- ✅ Two-way sync working in both directions
- ✅ Exclusion settings working correctly
- ✅ No console spam in production

### Bugs Fixed During Development:

1. **Daily note not found at startup** - Added workspace.onLayoutReady() listener
2. **Reverse sync not starting** - Added daily note creation listener
3. **Modify events not firing** - Fixed event watcher registration
4. **Completed tasks blocking resync** - Changed deduplication to only consider uncompleted tasks
5. **Source → Daily sync missing** - Created SourceToDailySyncService

## 2026-02-03 - Polish Phase 1: Foundation Refactoring

**Focus:** Code centralization and improved task matching

### Completed:

- ✅ Created `src/utils/TaskParser.ts` - centralized shared logic
- ✅ Refactored `TaskScannerService.ts` to use TaskParser
- ✅ Refactored `DailyNoteService.ts` to use TaskParser
- ✅ Refactored `ReverseSyncService.ts` to use TaskParser
- ✅ Refactored `SourceToDailySyncService.ts` to use TaskParser
- ✅ Implemented multi-signal task matching (cleanText + priority + lineNumber)
- ✅ Increased default debounce from 2000ms → 3500ms
- ✅ Increased max debounce slider from 5000ms → 10000ms

### Files Changed:

**Created:**
- `src/utils/TaskParser.ts` - Shared cleaning, parsing, matching logic

**Modified:**
- `src/services/TaskScannerService.ts` - Uses TaskParser
- `src/services/DailyNoteService.ts` - Uses TaskParser
- `src/services/ReverseSyncService.ts` - Uses TaskParser + multi-signal matching
- `src/services/SourceToDailySyncService.ts` - Uses TaskParser
- `src/settings.ts` - Debounce defaults updated

### Code Improvements:

- Removed ~200 lines of duplicated `cleanTaskText()` code
- Task matching now uses 3 signals instead of line number only
- Sync is more resilient to line insertions/deletions

### Testing Notes:

- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ Two-way sync still working
- ✅ Debounce prevents sync during active typing

## 2026-02-03 - Polish Phase 2: Incremental Scanning

**Focus:** Performance optimization - only scan files that changed

### Completed:

- ✅ Modified `TaskScannerService.scanVault()` to accept optional `file?: TFile`
- ✅ Added `scanFile(file: TFile)` method for single-file scanning
- ✅ Updated `FileWatcherService` to pass changed file to scanner
- ✅ Added exclusion check to `FileWatcherService.shouldTriggerSync()`
- ✅ Fixed stale cache bug - `scanFile()` skips `hasListItems()` check
- ✅ Fixed multi-file debounce - tracks pending file, falls back to full scan
- ✅ Fixed `taskLimit` bug - limit only applies to full vault scans

### Files Changed:

**Modified:**
- `src/services/TaskScannerService.ts` - Added `scanFile()` method, modified `scanVault()` signature
- `src/services/FileWatcherService.ts` - Passes file to callback, checks exclusions, tracks pending files
- `src/services/DailyNoteService.ts` - Added debug logging (temporary)
- `main.ts` - Updated callback, fixed taskLimit to only apply on full scans

### Bugs Fixed:

1. **Stale metadata cache** - `hasListItems()` uses cache which may not be updated after file modification; fixed by skipping cache check for incremental scans
2. **Task limit truncating new tasks** - `taskLimit` was applied before deduplication, cutting off new tasks; fixed by only applying limit to full vault scans

### Testing Notes:

- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ Excluded files don't trigger scans
- ✅ Non-excluded file changes only scan that file
- ✅ New tasks sync automatically to daily note
- ✅ Manual sync still performs full vault scan

## 2026-02-03 - Polish Phase 3: Polish & Cleanup

**Focus:** Clean up rough edges, fix memory leaks, add debug toggle

### Completed:

- ✅ Added `enableDebugLogging` setting to `PluginSettings`
- ✅ Added UI toggle for debug logging in settings (under "Developer" section)
- ✅ Gated verbose logs behind debug setting (troubleshooting logs remain visible)
- ✅ Added debounce to section header text input (300ms)
- ✅ Validated `debounceMs` on settings load (clamped to 500-10000)
- ✅ Cleaned up `create` event listener in `stopServices()` (stored ref for proper cleanup)
- ✅ Updated `ReverseSyncService` to accept settings for debug log gating

### Files Changed:

**Modified:**
- `src/settings.ts` - Added `enableDebugLogging` field, debounce for section header, new "Developer" settings section
- `main.ts` - Added debounceMs validation, stored createEventRef for cleanup
- `src/services/DailyNoteService.ts` - Gated verbose logs behind `enableDebugLogging`
- `src/services/ReverseSyncService.ts` - Added settings parameter, gated success log

### Testing Notes:

- ✅ Build passes (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Debug logging toggle visible in settings
- ✅ Section header changes debounced (no rapid saves)

## Git Commit Messages

### Phase 1 (previous):
```
refactor: centralize task parsing + improve matching logic

- Create src/utils/TaskParser.ts with shared cleaning/parsing/matching
- Refactor all 4 services to use TaskParser (removes ~200 lines duplication)
- Replace line-number-only matching with multi-signal approach
  (cleanText + priority + lineNumber, 2+ signals = match)
- Increase default debounce 2000ms → 3500ms
- Increase max debounce slider 5000ms → 10000ms

Files changed: TaskParser.ts (new), 4 services refactored, settings.ts
```

### Phase 2 (previous):
```
perf: implement incremental scanning for file changes

- Add scanFile() method for single-file scanning
- FileWatcherService now passes changed file to sync callback
- Skip excluded files at watcher level (early bailout)
- Fix stale cache: skip hasListItems() for incremental scans
- Fix taskLimit: only apply to full vault scans, not incremental

Performance: file edits now scan 1 file instead of entire vault
Files changed: TaskScannerService, FileWatcherService, main.ts
```

### Phase 3 (current):
```
chore: add debug logging toggle and cleanup memory leaks

- Add enableDebugLogging setting with UI toggle
- Gate verbose console logs behind debug setting
- Add 300ms debounce to section header input
- Validate debounceMs on load (clamp 500-10000)
- Fix event listener cleanup in stopServices()

Files changed: settings.ts, main.ts, DailyNoteService.ts, ReverseSyncService.ts
```
